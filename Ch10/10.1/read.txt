So to generate random number between x - y INCLUSIVE

We need to use rand() = random number between 36767
Finf diff = y - x => this is our range
If divide rand by this, remainder will give us random between 0 and y - x - 1

So we translate our divider by + 1:
divider = y - x + 1 => divider min unchanged at 0, max now becomes y - x
Now we get rand % divider = number {0, y - x}

then add x to translate to our range
number {x, y}
