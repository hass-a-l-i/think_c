- Example outputs for Q2–Q6 are shown in `WSD_report.pdf`, but all results can be reproduced by running the scripts.
- The `_eg` arguments in `Q6.py` can be modified to test that the proposed statistical method correctly identifies any set of numbers with a slightly increased selection probability.
